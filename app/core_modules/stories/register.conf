MODULE_NAME: [-stories-]
MODULE_DESCRIPTION: Manage the stories that appear on the default interface. The stories module provides a very lightweight content system that can provide valuable information to your users as they navigate through the log in process. Typically site stories are used to provide news updates and general information to users. Site stories can also interoperate with the comment module in order to get user feedback on the stories that you provide. Other features of the stories module include a way that certain stories content can be set to expire after a certain date, and a notification email will be sent to the story oner to notify them that the content has expired. This makes for a powerful, dynamic system for keeping your users up to date at all times.
