Thank you for installing 5ive. If you chose to install using 
Apache aliases, make sure you have restarted Apache for these settings to take
effect. You may login to the system <a href="<?php echo $login_url ?>">here</a>
(remember, the initial username is "root", with the password being whatever
you supplied earlier in the install).
