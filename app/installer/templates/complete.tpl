Thank you for installing Chisimba. If you chose to install using
Apache aliases, make sure you have restarted Apache for these settings to take
effect. <br /><a onclick="sq_redirect(this);" href="<?php echo $login_url ?>">You may login to the system here</a>
(remember, the initial username is "<strong>admin</strong>", with the password "<strong>a</strong>").<br />At this time you may want to join a users mailing list
in order to gain the full benefit of the Chisimba community.
